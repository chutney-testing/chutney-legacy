Feature: Agent test

Agent A (main) -> Agent B
We are the agent B. The agent A send us its network configuration in order we save it.

    Scenario: We receive a network configuration to persist
        Given network configuration initialized
            Do http-get Request current network configuration
                On CHUTNEY_LOCAL
                With uri /api/v1/description
